# Week2Challenge
What was the challenge?

To build SQL queries to return most popular products sold at specific times and most popular subcategories.

How I expected the challenge to go.

After this weeks training I expected the challenge to go well because I understood all of the concepts we were taught.

What went well?

I stuck with the challenge even though I found it really difficult.

What didn't go as planned?

The challenge was alot tougher than I expected and it took along longer than I originally thought it would.

Possible improvements for future challenges.

I think the challenge needs to be tailored more towards the things we were taught in the week, this challenge was significantly tougher that the concepts we went over in training.
